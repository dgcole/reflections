For my reflection last week, I submitted an interactive visualization of climate change-induced temperatures rises. For this week, I decided to continue along the same lines with a slightly different visualization, NOAA's [Sea Level Rise](https://coast.noaa.gov/slr/#/layer/slr) visualization. NOAA is obviously an authority on climate change and this visualization is very frequently updated.

This visualization allows you to view how sea level rise will inundate coastal areas with water (for the U.S.). The water level is configurable, from 0 ft to 10 ft, with a slider so that the user can select a variable degree of water level rise. The map then shows the coastal areas that will go underwater in a blue highlighted shade. There are also other features; local scenarios, marsh info, high tide flooding, and area vulnerability to flooding. The most interesting feature is the mapping confidence, which actually shows the projection's confidence in its calculations on which sections of the coast will become flooded.

I think that the visualization is overall a very good example of a map-based visualization. It is centered around the map as its core, and then the user can adjust factors / views and see how it affects the map in real time. As such, this is also more of a visualization intended for exploration.
